  <h3>Week 2: Laser Cutting </h3> <br> 
  <div class="row">
    
      This week we began our jounrey into 2D Design and Cutting!

      Below are the pieces I ended up desinging in Fusion 360.  

      <img src="./rainbow.png" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:20%" alt="Rainbow">

      <img src="./Cloud.png" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:50%" alt="Cloud">

      <img src="./raindrops.png" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:50%" alt="raindrops">
      
      <p> These are designs I created using some of the images I found on a website after searching for press-fit construction kits.</p>


      Documentation Week 2: 

      <p> This is <a href='http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.12/people/lindy/week2/index.html'>the link</a> I used to download the ".svg" files. To input these files into Fusion 360, I followed a fairly simply process. </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Download .svg files</li>
        <li>From here, press enter</li>
        <li>Hover over the new shape, and click when hilighted</li>
        <li>Find and click "Extrude" in the menu bar, and pull your image into the three dimensional plane</li>
        <li>Finally, in the lefthand menu, right click your sketch and save as a DXF file</li>
      </ol>
      </p>

      <p> Initally, I tried to complete the below sketch, by inputting this image as a background in Fusion 360. Then from there, I attempted to create lines and shapes around this background, esentially using the below image as a "template" to draw on. However, this proved mildly difficult so I approached the .svg approach outlined above. </p>

       <p> Once I obtained my DXF image, I tried to use the laser cutter but ran out of time as I could not quite figure out all of the settings involved. I will try again tomorrow to make the shape for class on Thursday. </p>
